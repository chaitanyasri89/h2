     <h2>Early life</h2>
     
     <p>Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937.[6]
         He is the son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, 
         and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather,
          Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents
           separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and 
           widow of Ratanji Tata.[7] He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata[8] and a half-brother, 
           Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.</p>
           <h2>career</h2>
           <img src="tatalogo.jpg"alt="tata"width="20%"height="100px">
           <p>In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group.
             He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics
              (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.[13][14] In 1991, J. R. D.
               Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, 
               Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of
                operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of
                 policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, 
                 having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to
                  contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation 
                  and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.[15] Under his leadership, overlapping 
                  operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, 
            with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation</p>
